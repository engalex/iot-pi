### Thinking About the Future

The future holds many things, all that may be, all that has yet to come, along with the affirmation or denial of those intentions we hold to in the here and now. This series will seek to explore the realm of what is now being referred to as a combination of "smart devices" and the IoT (Internet of Things).

### Thoughts and More

I'm a person that, often as not, when attempting to work through a situation in my head, will sometimes think aloud. Working as a web developer, that often means that I'm either taking notes, furiously typing out some thoughts into a rough example, or just trying something out, all while sometimes muttering away furiously.

One of the reasons I [blog with some regularity](https://edm00se.io/) is to keep track of what I've learned, what I've accomplished, and what I should focus on next. I also enjoy sharing with and learning form others and, being a big fan of open source, it's my way of "giving back" to the communities which has helped me greatly. So, with all this combined, I'm currently seeking out what direction(s) and [sorts of mini projects](https://github.com/edm00se/iot-pi/issues/1) (some a bit less 'miniature') I would like to spend my time on. I have a few ideas already, but I'm looking for more input and perspective from people, specifically in regards to some of the preconceptions we bring to certain things like what IoT is and is **for**.

### Announcing: Crowd Sourced Input!

I hope that sounds exciting, as I'm trying to get a feel for what people find interesting in this space. To cut to the chase, I would love some feedback from people as to what they think on a few things. Instead of laying it all out here, I'm taking the direction of [an interesting format of an AMA I saw recently, on GitHub](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ama). To participate, all you need is [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and a willingness to participate in a civil fashion.

[The questions I'm posing](https://github.com/edm00se/iot-pi/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion+) are:

* [What Can Be an IoT/Use?](https://github.com/edm00se/iot-pi/issues/2)
* [What Should Be An IoT (or Shouldn't)?](https://github.com/edm00se/iot-pi/issues/3)
* [What Can Be Accomplished via the IoT?](https://github.com/edm00se/iot-pi/issues/4)
* [What Is Most Advantageous (to Humans) from IoT?](https://github.com/edm00se/iot-pi/issues/5)

Feel free to comment on those questions (which are GitHub issues with a label of "question" for this repository). I'll leave the questions open for a little while, sift through the responses, and update with an initial road map. I think this can bring a little form to the thoughts in my head which are, at present, a bit amorphous and lacking in definition.

### Summary

All in all, I have a few projects and sub-projects I'd love to tackle, but I'd rather work on something people would _actually like to see_, so please check those links out, discuss and contribute, and I'll be happy to hear everyones' thoughts.
