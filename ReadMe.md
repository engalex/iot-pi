## Micro-Blog

This is the `gh-pages` branch of the project, containing the micro-blog affiliated with it. For the main repository, check out [the `master`](https://github.com/edm00se/iot-pi/tree/master) branch, or view the [actual micro-blog](https://edm00se.github.io/iot-pi) directly; although, you could just peruse the `_posts` directory for content, but it won't be as pretty.
