### Launching in T-Minus 10... 9... 8...!

[My usual blog](https://edm00se.io/) isn't quite the right place to chronicle my adventures in this space, so I'm launching a new one. In any case, this will grow over time, so please stay tuned. I'm also going with a soft launch, which will be more publicly announced after I start fielding some thoughts and deciding on a few aspects of the direction I want to take this. Hopefully this will let me field out some preliminary work without getting too sidetracked to let this fall by the wayside.

### Releases

As I release (initial, then updated) versions of my experiments, I'll update the [/experiments page]({{ site.url }}/releases). I hope that's simple enough.

### Experiments?

Are these actual experiments? No, not in the scientific sense. I may eventually change the terminology I'm using, but until then, it's what I'm rolling with. The idea behind this project is to engage in a short series of mini projects which highlight capabilities and build on different levels of complexity, to make for a more complete picture of the virtual landscape regarding the era of "smart things" (IoT or otherwise).
