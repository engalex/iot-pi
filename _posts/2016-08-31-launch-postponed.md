### Launching Delayed Due to Stormy Conditions

Contrary to my previous "soft launch" of this site, I'm going to be delaying this project and its affiliated series of content. This summer has gotten all sorts of crazy, so it'll likely be something I pick back up in winter. Thanks for checking in, I'll hope to have more for "show and tell" sometime around November or December. Thanks!
